<h3>Tag auditorium is almost always filled with buzzling activity. Being the second largest stage in Anna university, ‘Tag Audi’ as the students call it, is a place for many theatre performances, cultural events and MUNs. It seats upto 150-200 people. It was one of the more recent constructions and needed lesser labor due to its compact structure. Since many events occur here, it’s a very common hangout spot among the students.</h3>
