 <h3>The Government of Tamil Nadu established the Anna University of Technology on 4 September 1978, through Tamil Nadu Act 30 of 1978.

In 1982, the current name "Anna University" was adopted.
In 2001, under the Anna University Amendment Act of 2001, the university became an affiliating university, taking under its wings all the engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu. This included six government engineering colleges, three government-aided private institutions, and 426 self-financing colleges. On 1 February 2007, as a result of a Government of Tamil Nadu decision, the university was split into six constituent universities: Anna University, Chennai, Anna University of Technology, Chennai, Anna University of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, Anna University of Technology, Coimbatore, Anna University of Technology Tirunelveli and Anna University of Technology, Madurai. The institutes were formally created in 2010. 
On 14 September 2011, a bill was passed to merge back the universities. The merger became final in August 2012.

In 2011 and 2012 the constituents were merged back to a single affiliating university and the four regional universities continue to function as regional campus of the university.</h3>
